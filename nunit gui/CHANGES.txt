NUnit-Gui 0.1 - April 8, 2016

General

This is the initial release of the NUnit GUI runner. This is pre-alpha code we are releasing
primarily for the purpose of getting feedback on the user interface itself. It is not suitable
for use in production.

Features

 * The left-hand panel displays the tests in a variety of ways.
   * As a traditional NUnit tree
   * As a list of fixtures
   * As a list of test cases

 * When displaying a list of fixtures or test cases, you may select various groupings. 
   This is similar to how the Visual Studio test explorer window works.

 * The right-hand panel displays information about the individual test selected in the 
   left-hand panel. It has two tabs.
   * Properties - shows the information about the test (upper pane) and it's result (lower pane)
   * XML - shows the XML representation for the test or test result
